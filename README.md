Project Description:	chat-- is an enhanced, web-based chat service wherein
						users can both use and develop customized functions to
						enhance their chatting experience. Using built-in 
						commands specified by a special character, the user 
						can perform special actions to the text they enter,
						or send terminal-like commands from the chat window.

						For example, proposed commands could:
						-> automatically send the contents of the chat message
						   as an email
						-> re-format the appearance of the text with different
						   font, font size, color, or justification. Also mark
						   it up with bold, italic, underline, strike-through,
						   etc...
						-> open up a new tab in the web browser with Google
						   search results for a chat message string sent with
						   the command
						-> auto-send a picture from Google image results of the
						   chat message sent with the command
						-> manipulate the computer's audio: Play/pause music, 
						   skip tracks, adjust volume, mute...
						-> re-map keys, to manipulate what gets sent when
						   certain characters or strings are sent in chat.

						The second part of this project would be to provide
						tools and methods for users to easily develop their own
						custom commands for chat--, which could be added on
						in a similar manner to plugins or browser extensions
						to give the tool extra functionality.
