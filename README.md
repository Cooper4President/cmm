**Vision Statement:**
An enhanced, extensible, and enjoyable web chat experience.

**Motivation:**
To fulfill the requirements of the CSCI 3308 semester project, gain practical experience, and produce a fun and useful product.

**Project Description:**
chat-- is a feature-rich web chat service wherein users can both use and 
develop customized functions to enhance their chatting experience. Using 
built-in commands specified by a special character, the user can perform 
special actions to the text they enter, or send terminal-like commands from the
chat window.

For example, proposed commands could:

- automatically send the contents of the chat message as an email
- re-format the appearance of the text with different font, font size, color, 
   or justification. Also mark it up with bold, italic, underline, 
   strike-through, etc...
- open up a new tab in the web browser with Google search results for a chat 
   message string sent with the command
- auto-send a picture from Google image results of the chat message sent with 
   the command
- manipulate the computer's audio: Play/pause music, skip tracks, adjust 
   volume, mute...
- re-map keys, to manipulate what gets sent when certain characters or strings
   are sent in chat.

The second part of this project would be to provide tools and methods for users
to easily develop their own custom commands for chat--, which could be added on
in a similar manner to plugins or browser extensions to give the tool extra 
functionality.

**Possible Risks to Project Completion:**
- Team members have varying levels of experience with web programming
- Lack of previous experience with web-app projects makes estimation of project time and complexity difficult

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
- Start small, don't bite off more than you can chew
- Break down project into small, manageable goals
- Minimize number of new technologies / frameworks for team members to learn

**Process Methodology:**
Agile

**Project Tracking:**
We will be using Trello.
