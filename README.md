Project Description:
chat-- is an enhanced, web-based chat service wherein users can both use and 
develop customized functions to enhance their chatting experience. Using 
built-in commands specified by a special character, the user can perform 
special actions to the text they enter, or send terminal-like commands from the
chat window.

For example, proposed commands could:
-> automatically send the contents of the chat message as an email
-> re-format the appearance of the text with different font, font size, color, 
   or justification. Also mark it up with bold, italic, underline, 
   strike-through, etc...
-> open up a new tab in the web browser with Google search results for a chat 
   message string sent with the command
-> auto-send a picture from Google image results of the chat message sent with 
   the command
-> manipulate the computer's audio: Play/pause music, skip tracks, adjust 
   volume, mute...
-> re-map keys, to manipulate what gets sent when certain characters or strings
   are sent in chat.

The second part of this project would be to provide tools and methods for users
to easily develop their own custom commands for chat--, which could be added on
in a similar manner to plugins or browser extensions to give the tool extra 
functionality.
